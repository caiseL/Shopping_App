# shopping_app_firebase

A shopping app using Firebase. \
This is a project I made long ago using Firebase and Cloudinary. It was the first programming project that I was really proud of. \
The software architecture that I used it's bad and it doesn't have a good documentation because it was the first one, but I think it looks great.

-   Posting product photos on Cloudinary used to work but I haven't code on this project in a long time, so it's outdated.
